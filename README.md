Ludum Dare 38: A Small World

It's an incremental game in the solar system

Written in jQuery with no &lt;canvas> or anything, just plain DOM.

This branch is default and maintained because it was the source for LD, which
was recent enough that I want to keep the link live. Continued (post-compo)
development now lives in the **master** branch.
